      <h1 > Overview </h1>
      <p>This simple, static website was an assignment I completed for my Writing With Digital Technologies class.</p>
      <p>This assignment was designed to introduce students to HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>This project took 4 weeks in September of 2019.</p>

      <h1>Role</h1>
      <p>Projects were assigned individually. I had the following responsibilities for this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User Research</li>
        <li>Wireframing</li>
        <li>Code-based prototyping</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 > The Prompt </h1>
      <h2>“Develop a simple static website for a client of your choosing”</h2>
      <p>Initially, I had trouble finding a client that needed a website developed.
        After talking with my classmates about this common issue, I decided to reach out to some non profits and offer to redesign a portion of their website.</p>

      <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
      <p>I centered in on three competitors to analyze; Craigslist, TaskRabbit, and Upwork.</p>
      <p>These websites did a lot of really nice things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Both Upwork and TaskRabbit seemed trustworthy</li>
        <li>Both Upwork and TaskRabbit had nice progress bars</li>
        <li>Only Craigslist allowed non-posters to access the full extent of their experience without signing in</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They also had some common faults:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Signup prompts popped up after making it through each process</li>
        <li>The entire proces of posting a job takes too long</li>
        <li>Craigslist in particular feels a little untrustworthy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Craigslist is primarily for peer to peer sales, their service component is therefore peer to peer.
        Both Upwork and TaskRabbit are geared towards connecting users who need service with users that are professionals.
        What I hoped to build with Solysit was a peer to peer service with the same userbase as Craigslist while maintaing the same level of trust that service like Upwork and TaskRabbit thrive on.

      <h1 > User Persona </h1>
      <p>
        After settling on a service marketplace, I created two personas to ensure my designs stayed user focused.
        David resents a user that is looking for work and Vanessa represents a user that is looking for help.

      <h1>User Problem</h1>
      <p>Websites that keep their services behind login restrictions loose out on many prospective users and end up with a smaller pool of users.
         Craigslist has does an excellent job of capturing this "guest user" market but a poor job of building trust and quality control into its services.</p>
      <p>Common user pain points</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lengthy Sign up Processes</li>
        <li>Not being able to trust other users</li>
        <li>Lack of transparency betweent a service and its users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Accounting for these insights, I set out to develop an experience that</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensures user tasks are quick and easy</li>
        <li>Devleops trust amongst its users</li>
        <li>Facilitates complete access for guest users</li>

      <h1 > Wire Flow </h1>
      <p>
        I started with a user flow to map out how the ideal experience for both sets of users.
        Given the constraints of this project I had to keep the flow and the overall design short and simple.

        Since I included simple illustrations of each screen in my user-flow, I had a good idea on how I wanted the first set of wires to look.

      <p>
        Using Invision I drafted a clickable prototype to present to users during my user testing. Invision only allows users to create one free prototype so this is the final product.

        This prototype is the results of several rounds of user testing and an overhaul of the user interface design.

        In this round of user testing I interviewed two customers at Dogwood Coffee and  three customers at Spyhouse coffee in Northeast Minneapolis.
            </br>    </br>
        Here are some of the takeaways from this round of user testing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users new exactly what Solysit was used for</li>
        <li>One of the users struggled to understand the “Get Help” button was used to make a post</li>
        <li>One user brought up an edgecase where they would be making a post for work that is different than their location</li>
        <li>Users found Solysit to be a quick and easy way to request help from their peers</li>

      <h2 > Round One: Adjustments </h2>
      <p>
        After this round of testing I felt that Solysit was close to its final state making only the following adjustments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the “Get Paid” and “Get Help” buttons to say “Find Work” and “Find Help”</li>
        <li>Added a spot to enter a location into the “Add Content” screen.</li>

      <h2 > Round Two: Moderated User Testing </h2>
      <p>
        In this round of user testing I interviewed three young adults at a Spyhouse coffee in downtown Minneapolis.
            </br>    </br>
        Here are some of the takeaways from this round of user testing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users were a little confused about the homepage saying “Work for your friends”</li>
        <li>Users navigated the interface with significant ease</li>
        <li>Users felt unsure about how long each flow would take</li>
        <li>Users felt that the interface was very user friendly and intuitive overall</li>
        <li>One user wanted to be able to use there current location rather than enter it</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 > Round Two: Adjustments </h2>
      <p>
        After this round of testing I felt pretty confident in my designs and made fewer adjustments that the first round of testing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the homepage to say “Work for each other”</li>
        <li>Added a “Use current location button”</li>
        <li>Added a Navigation bar to give users some idea about how long and where each flow was going</li>
        <li>Added a Map to give users another way to view the results</li>

      <h1> Solysit's Success</h1>
      <p>
        At the beginning of this project I set out with the goal to gain a comprehensive understanding of UX design.
        This project has certainly helped me do that. I created a User Experience design that in the end users found intuitive and could see themselves using.
        By every measure I set for myself, this project was a success.

      <h1> Takeaways </h1>
      <p>
        I learned a lot about about user experience design throughout this project.
         Here are the three key takeaways that will strengthen my designs in the future:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Thought over fidelity</h3>
          When I digitized my wires, I spent more time focusing on how my designs looked rather than how they functioned.
          I spent a lot of time redesigning my experience after the first round of user testing because of this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Organize early</h3>
          When I created my first digital wireframes I didn’t take the time to name and group all of the constituent elements for each screen.
          When it came time to adjust my designs I wasted a lot of time differentiating between “Rectangle copy copy copy” and “Rectangle copy copy copy copy”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Thorough user research</h3>
          The class I developed this in had not required students to perform qualitative interviews with potential users before developing their designs.
          I think this would have helped me better understand user pain points and create a design more distinguishable from other service marketplaces.
        </li>
      </ol>
