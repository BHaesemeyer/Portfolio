        <p>This user experience was designed for a project in  DES 3131- User Experience in Design.</p>
        <p>This assignment was designed to give students a full understanding of UX Research and Design.</p>
        <p>This project took 7 weeks between September and October of 2019.</p>

        <h1>Role</h1>
        <p>Projects were assigned individually. I had the following responsibilities for this project:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>User Research</li>
          <li>UX Design</li>
          <li>Prototyping</li>

      <h1 > The Prompt </h1>
      <h2> Design an experience that is centered around kindness </h2>
      <p>After a couple brainstorming exercises I came up with the idea for an elderly-assistance app. While I was making a user empathy map I realized that what I was designing could expand out to a much wider audience than just elderly people. Finally I settled on the idea of creating a service market place.</p>
      <p>Solysit is an app that connects users who need services like yardwork, maintenance, or cleaning, with users who are looking for work or supplemental income.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class="margincontainer">

    <div class="flexcol" >
      <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
      <p>I centered in on three competitors to analyze: Craigslist, TaskRabbit, and Upwork.</p>
      <p>These websites did a lot of really nice things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Both Upwork and TaskRabbit seemed trustworthy</li>
        <li>Both Upwork and TaskRabbit had nice progress bars</li>
        <li>Only Craigslist allowed non-posters to access the full extent of their experience without signing in</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They also had a few faults:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Signup prompts popped up after making it through each process</li>
        <li>The entire proces of posting a job takes too long</li>
        <li>Craigslist in particular feels a little untrustworthy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Craigslist is primarily for peer to peer sales, their service component is therefore peer to peer.
        Both Upwork and TaskRabbit are geared towards connecting users to professionals.
        What I hoped to build with Solysit was a peer to peer service, with the same userbase as Craigslist, while maintaing the same level of trust that services like Upwork and TaskRabbit thrive on.

      <h1 > User Personas </h1>
      <p>
        After settling on a service marketplace, I created two personas to ensure my designs stayed user focused.
        David represents a user that is looking for work and Vanessa represents a user that is looking for help.

      <h1>User Problem</h1>
      <p>Through a competitive analysis and creating user empathy maps, I foused on three common pain points for users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lengthy sign up processes</li>
        <li>Not being able to trust other users</li>
        <li>Lack of transparency between services and their users</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Accounting for these insights, I set out to develop an experience that</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensures user tasks are quick and easy</li>
        <li>Devleops trust amongst its users</li>
        <li>Facilitates complete access for guest users</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="flexrow">
    <div class="flexcol" >
      <h1 > User Flow </h1>
      <p>
        I started with a user flow to map the ideal user experience.
        Given the constraints of this project I had to keep the flow and the overall design short and simple.

      <h1 >Drafting Wireframes </h1>
      <p>
        Since I included simple illustrations for each screen in my user-flow, I had a good idea on how I wanted the first set of wires to look.

      <h1> Digitizing Wireframes </h1>
      <p>
        Next I digitized my wireframes. At this point in my project I was working on a Dell XPS laptop and did not have access to Sketch.
        I used a program called Lunacy to create sketch files for my wireframes. This high-fidelity draft is where I introduced a lot of copy.
        I had 5 screens at this stage here is how they looked:

      <h1 > Clickable Prototype </h1>
      <p>
        After a peer review and a lot of helpful feedback I redesigned my screens for a clickable prototype.
        Using Invision I drafted a clickable prototype to present to users during my user testing.

        Here are some of the takeaways from this round of user testing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users understood exactly what Solysit was from the hero page</li>
        <li>Users understood exactly how to find work</li>
        <li>Users struggled to understand how to post a request</li>
        <li>Users enjoyed the overall simplicity</li>

      <h2 > Round One: Adjustments </h2>
      <p>
        After this round of testing and at the suggestion of my Professor McLean Donnelly, I purchased a Macbook Pro and rebuilt my screens in Sketch.
      </br>    </br>
         Some of the improvements included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearer distinctions between the two main flows: “Get Paid” and “Get Help”</li>
        <li>Two screens added to the flows to get some filtering or onboarding information from users</li>
        <li>Updated copy to mitigate confusion in user testing</li>
        <li>Clearer representations of user ratings</li>
        <li>Removal of “social media” features such as the trending feed and likes and comments on postings</li>

      <h2 > Round Two: Moderated User Testing </h2>
      <p>
        In this round of user testing I interviewed customers at a Spyhouse coffee in downtown Minneapolis.
            </br>    </br>
        Here are some of the takeaways from this round of user testing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users were a little confused about the homepage saying “Work for your friends”</li>
        <li>Users navigated the interface with significant ease</li>
        <li>Users were unsure how long each flow would take</li>
        <li>Users felt that the interface was very user friendly and intuitive</li>
        <li>One user wanted to be able to click "use their current location" rather than enter it</li>

      <h2 > Round Two: Adjustments </h2>
      <p>
        After this round of testing I felt pretty confident in my designs and made fewer adjustments than the first round of testing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the homepage to say “Work For Each Other”</li>
        <li>Added a “Use current location button”</li>
        <li>Added a Navigation bar to give users some idea where each flow was going</li>
        <li>Added a Map to give users another way to view the results</li>

        In this final round of user testing I interviewed two customers at Dogwood Coffee and  three customers at Spyhouse coffee in Northeast Minneapolis.
            </br>    </br>
        Here are some of the takeaways from this round of user testing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users new exactly what Solysit was used for</li>
        <li>One of the users struggled to understand that the “Get Help” button was used to make a post</li>
        <li>One user brought up an edge case where they would be making a post for work that is different than their location</li>
        <li>Users found Solysit to be a quick and easy way to request help from their peers</li>

      <p>
        After this round of testing I felt that Solysit was close to its final state making only the following adjustments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the “Get Paid” and “Get Help” buttons to say “Find Work” and “Find Help”</li>
        <li>Added a spot to enter a Zip Code into the “Add Content” screen.</li>

        <h1> Solysit's Success</h1>
        <p>
          At the beginning of this project I set out with the goal to gain a comprehensive understanding of UX design.
          This project has certainly helped me do that:
          <ul>
            <li>I created user personas and learned to design with the use in mind</li>
            <li>I gained experience with Sketch, InVision, and Whimsical</li>
            <li>I designed a user experience that users found intuitive and could see themselves using</li>
            <li>I learned that I enjoy designing user experiences</li>
          </ul>
          By every measure I set for myself, this project was a success.
        </p>

        <h1> Takeaways </h1>
        <p>
          I learned a lot about about User Experience Design throughout this project.
           Here are the three key takeaways that will strengthen my designs in the future:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Thought Over Fidelity</h3>
            When I digitized my wires, I spent more time focusing on how my designs looked rather than how they functioned.
            I spent a lot of time redesigning my experience after the first round of user testing because of this.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Organize Early</h3>
            When I created my first digital wireframes I didn’t take the time to name and group all of the constituent elements for each screen.
            When it came time to adjust my designs I wasted a lot of time differentiating between “Rectangle copy copy copy” and “Rectangle copy copy copy copy”.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Thorough User Research</h3>
            For this design I did not perform qualitative interviews with potential users before developing my user experience.
            I think this would have helped me better understand user pain points and create a design more distinguishable from other service marketplaces.
