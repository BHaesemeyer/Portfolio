    <h1 > Overview </h1>
    <p>This user experience was designed for a project in  DES 3131- User Experience in Design.</p>
    <p>This assignment was designed to give students a full understanding of UX Research and Design.</p>
    <p>This project took 7 weeks between September and October of 2019.</p>

    <h1>Role</h1>
    <p>Projects were assigned individually. I had the following responsibilities for this project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>User Research</li>
      <li>UX Design</li>
      <li>Prototyping</li>
      <li>Usability Testing</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 > The Prompt </h1>
    <h2>“Design an experience that is centered around kindness”</h2>
    <p>I did some Crazy-8’s and came up with the idea for an elderly-assistance app. While I was making a user empathy map I realized that what I was designing could expand out to a much wider audience than just elderly people.</p>
    <p>Solysit is a service marketplace that aims to connect people who need help with people who need financial assistance.</p>

    <h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
    <p>Solysist was hardly an original idea, the nice thing about this was I had plenty of competition to review. I centered in on three competitors; Craigslist, TaskRabbit, and Upwork.</p>
    <p>These websites did a lot of really nice things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Both Upwork and TaskRabbit seemed trustworthy</li>
      <li>Both Upwork and TaskRabbit had nice progress bars</li>
      <li>Only Craigslist allowed non-posters to access the full extent of their experience without signing in</li>
    </ul>
    <p>They also had some common faults:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Signup prompts popped up after making it through each process</li>
      <li>The entire proces of posting a job takes too long</li>
      <li>Craigslist in particular feels a little untrustworthy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I think that is a disconnect between Craigslist and services like Upwork and TaskRabbit.
      Craigslist is primarily for peer to peer sales, their service component is therefore peer to peer.
      Both Upwork and TaskRabbit are geared towards connecting users who need service with users that are professionals.
      What I hoped to build with Solysit was a peer to peer service with the same userbase as Craigslist while maintaing the same level of trust that service like Upwork and TaskRabbit thrive on. </p>

    <h1 > User Personas </h1>
    <p>After settling on a service marketplace, I created two personas to ensure my designs stayed user focused. The first empathy map resents a user that is looking for work and the second represents a user that is looking for help.</p>
